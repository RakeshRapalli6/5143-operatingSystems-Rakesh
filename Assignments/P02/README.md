#### Overview:
This is a project written in python that implements a Virtual FileSystem.
Then we mimick shell commands on the virtual file system that's been created.
we used sqlite to create a database,created a table,made a connection to the database and inserted the fake files into the it.
Once the data has been pushed to the table now we wrote functions to mimick the shell commands such as ls -lah, mk_dir, cd,
mv, cp, rm, pwd and chmod.
We mimick the shell commands with the help of some of the built-in functions of the sqlite such as insert, search, update and delete.
